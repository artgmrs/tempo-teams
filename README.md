# What is Tempo Teams

The application `tempo teams` fetchs a list of teams from an API and show an overview of them. It's possible to navigate between teams to check more details. In the team's details page, the app fetchs the team details and a list of users.

This project was built using mainly: React, React Router, Axios, Redux, Jest and RTL and Material UI.

# My approach

The whole idea was to keep it `simple and functional` (simple doesn't mean it's not good), starting to the components which are reusable in the application and going to the tests which I've designed to be more like `integration tests` that cover render and functionality in the same unit test.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
